This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Liz's Pirate Shop

A React app that implements an online store 
that houses only the very best DVD's and Blu-Ray discs, for 
a fraction of the price!

App uses the Material-UI framework and React Hooks
to have simple functional components and global
state management. 


## Build Instructions

App requires Node.js/npm and React 16.8 or 
later to be installed.

After unzipping the project, navigate to its root
directory from a terminal:

1. Run `npm install` 
from the project's root directory to install its
dependencies
2. Run `npm run start` from the root directory to 
start the project. The app should then be 
viewable on `http://localhost:3000`
